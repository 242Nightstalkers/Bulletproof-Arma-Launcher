Hello,

I'm the author of TacBF Launcher, a software that is an installer and launcher for Tactical Battlefield - a mod for the game Arma 3.

The launcher is written in python and then wrapped with PyInstaller to create an exe file. Its sources are freely available here:
https://bitbucket.org/tacbf_launcher/tacbf_launcher

The wrapped exe can be downloaded here:

Direct link: https://bitbucket.org/tacbf_launcher/tacbf_launcher/downloads/TB_Launcher.exe

Unfortunately, the launcher is regarded as a threat by your antivirus (<Name Here>), as can be seen on this Virustotal report:

Please update your AV rules/patterns. Also please note that this software is still being developed, which means new versions are going to be released in the future and the code *will* change. This means, whitelisting based on file checksums will not work.
Please RSVP as soon as possible!
